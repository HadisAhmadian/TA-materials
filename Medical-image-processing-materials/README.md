## Intelligent Analysis of Biomedical Images
## My Contribution

In my role as a Teaching Assistant (TA), I actively contributed to the creation, grading, and management of educational materials for the course **Intelligent Analysis of Biomedical Images**. I also took the lead in managing the assignment design team, ensuring the delivery of high-quality tasks that enhanced students' understanding of theoretical and practical aspects of medical image processing and analysis.

### Topics Covered

1. **Medical Imaging Modalities**
   - Studied imaging techniques such as MRI, PET/CT, and Ultrasound.
   - Investigated parameters like T1/T2 times, contrast mechanisms, and rotation angles.
   - Applied GAN-based methods for PET image reconstruction, contrasting with traditional techniques.

2. **Image Processing Techniques**
   - Developed and analyzed noise removal and image enhancement methods using filters (e.g., high-pass, low-pass).
   - Utilized concepts like Dynamic Range and Point Spread Function for image quality assessment.

3. **Deep Learning Applications**
   - Designed PyTorch-based models for MRI image classification, including pre-trained architectures like ResNet.
   - Addressed data imbalance issues with advanced training strategies.
   - Evaluated models with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
   - Visualized feature spaces with t-SNE to explore model strengths and weaknesses.

4. **DICOM Data Processing**
   - Loaded, visualized, and anonymized DICOM medical images.
   - Enhanced image quality using spatial and frequency-domain filters.
   - Implemented noise injection and removal techniques to simulate real-world challenges.
