# Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) - Jupyter Notebooks (Python and Julia)

## About This Repository

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks designed as part of the **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** course at Sharif University of Technology, under the supervision of **Dr. Rouhban**. These notebooks focus on solving **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)** using Python and Julia programming languages.

The materials are designed to help students understand CSP concepts, apply algorithms, and implement solutions for real-world bioinformatics and optimization tasks.

## Notebooks Overview

### **1. CSP_cell_python.ipynb**
- **Language:** Python
- **Description:**
  - Models a set of metabolic reactions using stoichiometric matrices.
  - Identifies reversible and irreversible reactions based on provided constraints.
  - Uses CSP techniques to detect and remove blocked reactions that cannot occur under any conditions.
  - Preprocessing data to simplify problem-solving in metabolic networks.

### **2. CSP_cell_julia.ipynb**
- **Language:** Julia
- **Description:**
  - Implements similar concepts as the Python notebook, utilizing Julia's performance capabilities.
  - Includes practical applications in bioinformatics for designing synthetic pathways in bacteria.
  - Explores engineering metabolic reactions for optimized drug synthesis, such as insulin production.
  - Highlights the use of Julia packages like `COBREXA` and `JuMP` for efficient modeling and optimization.
