## NLP Materials
## **Role and Contribution**
In this repository, I was actively involved in designing and grading the assignments, managing student submissions, and mentoring students during their presentations. My responsibilities included:
- Designing the structure and content of the assignments.
- Developing evaluation rubrics and criteria.
- Providing feedback and support for students’ work.

## **Content Overview**
The materials in this repository cover key NLP topics and practical applications, such as:

### 1. **Document Classification**
- Assignments focus on classifying documents into predefined categories using classical and advanced machine learning models.
- Includes the use of models like Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Transformer-based architectures such as BERT.

### 2. **Text Generation**
- Students work on generating meaningful and coherent text, such as generating titles for news articles or summarizing documents.
- Emphasis is placed on using transformer-based models like T5 and GPT variants for creative and effective text generation.

### 3. **Bioinformatics-Focused Tasks**
This section explores the intersection of NLP and bioinformatics, highlighting:
- **Disease Diagnosis and Drug Recommendation**: Developing models to analyze medical symptoms and recommend treatments.
- **Medical Question Answering**: Building systems that retrieve and generate answers to medical questions based on datasets like PubMed.
- **Document Summarization for Clinical Trials**: Simplifying complex medical documentation for broader understanding and accessibility.
- **Token Classification for Medical Entities**: Implementing models to identify key medical entities (e.g., drugs, dosages, and conditions) in clinical text.
