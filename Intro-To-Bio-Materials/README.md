## Content Overview

### **Examinations**
- **Midterm Exam**: Focused on fundamental concepts like transcription, RNA folding algorithms, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic tree construction.
- **Final Exam**: Included advanced topics such as Burrows-Wheeler Transform, Hidden Markov Models, motif discovery, and dynamic programming algorithms.
- **Quizzes**: Covered problem-solving on sequence alignment, gene expression analysis, and microarray data interpretation.

### **Projects**
#### **Phase 1**: Microarray Data Analysis
- Analyzed microarray datasets related to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
- Key tasks: data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (PCA, MDS, t-SNE), and visualizing group similarities.

#### **Phase 2**: Gene Expression and Pathway Analysis
- Identified overexpressed/underexpressed genes.
- Conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis.
- Investigated AML-related pathways and proposed drug connections.

### **Weekly Assignments**
- Weekly exercises using Rosalind problem sets to reinforce bioinformatics algorithms and concepts, including sequence alignment, phylogenetics, motif finding, and RNA structure prediction.
